üîß Projects

### 1. Analysis of Data from the Pierre Auger Observatory

#### Description
In collaboration with the Astrophysics Group of the Autonomous University of Chiapas, I conducted an in-depth analysis of data released by the Pierre Auger Observatory. The project focused on investigating the origin of cosmic rays and analyzing their anisotropy. The study involved utilizing ROOT and Python, along with extensive use of databases and relevant scientific literature. As a final step, I developed a graphical interface using Tkinter for the automation of correlation searches between various observatory variables.

#### Technologies Used
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/): Data analysis framework.
- Python: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- Tkinter: GUI toolkit for building the graphical interface.
- Databases: Leveraged databases for storing and retrieving relevant data.

#### Project Repository
Codes and data can not be published.

### 2. Development of Optimization Algorithms for Material Properties Determination

#### Description
In this project, I focused on the development and implementation of optimization algorithms, including Genetic, Levenberg-Marquardt, Gauss, and Gravitational Vortex algorithms. The primary objective was to determine the constitutive properties of a material. All algorithms were implemented using Python, providing versatile and efficient solutions for material characterization.

#### Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language for algorithm development.
- Genetic Algorithm: Optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection.
- Levenberg-Marquardt: Non-linear optimization algorithm.
- Gauss Algorithm: Optimization using Gaussian elimination method.
- Gravitational Vortex Algorithm: A nature-inspired optimization algorithm.

### 3. NASA Space Apps Challenge - Data Access and Analysis Web Application

#### Description
Participated in the NASA Space Apps Challenge where we developed a web application for the efficient handling, unpacking, utilization, and analysis of data from the NASA Data Center. The application facilitates scientists to instantly access and unpack large datasets, allowing for quick utilization. Additionally, the application provides graphical representations of variable correlations, along with measures such as Pearson coefficients and more.

#### Technologies Used
- Python: Backend development and data analysis.
- NASA Data Center API: Access and retrieval of NASA datasets.
- Data Visualization: Utilized libraries for graphical representations.
